    "disclaimer": "### When using AI tools avoid sharing any information, if you have not made sure you are allowed to share it. That is, when you are entering prompts to an AI tool, make sure that you consider any possible confidentiality restrictions and that you have acquired the necessary copyright permits, licenses etc. for sharing the entered information. Any unauthorized use of information within AI systems may lead to infringement of third-party IP rights. \n \n ### CurreChat utilizes large language models developed by OpenAI, which are located in the Microsoft Azure cloud service of the University of Helsinki within the EU region. The information input into the service is not used to further train the language model. Additionally, no user identification information is passed on to the language model. \n \n ### Each user has 75,000 tokens available for the GPT-4 language model. This balance resets every month. To reduce token consumption, it is advisable to clear the conversation using the CLEAR button whenever you change the topic of conversation. \n \n ### You can see the token consumption and the language model in use underneath the conversation window. \n ### You can learn more about tokens used by large language models here: [https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them). \n \n ### You can find more information about the use of artificial intelligence in teaching at: [https://teaching.helsinki.fi/instructions/article/artificial-intelligence-teaching](https://teaching.helsinki.fi/instructions/article/artificial-intelligence-teaching). \n ### Please contact [opetusteknologiapalvelut@helsinki.fi](mailto:opetusteknologiapalvelut@helsinki.fi) with any questions regarding CurreChat."
